# Credits
I don't own any of the rights to the wallpapers, they're all pulled from Unsplash, Wallhaven or other peoples' wallpaper repos. Most of my Matugen templates are pulled from the [Matugen Themes](https://github.com/InioX/matugen-themes) repo, some with minor changes for my system. The rest of the configs are my own, some with minor inspiration from other peoples' dots but without any exact code copying.
